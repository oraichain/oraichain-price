## AI Oracle background

The AI Oracle protocol developed by Oraichain allows users to run AI services such as AI pricefeed, face recognition, or OCR in a decentralized manner.

The Oraichain's validators execute the AI requests and return the aggregated results, which are already verified by test cases.

Third party test case providers are responsible for verification process, and are rewarded accordingly.

Users can use any aggregated result provided by any validator for their services.

## AI pricefeed integration process

To continuously and automatically request and collect tokens' prices using Oraichain, it is recommended to use Cosmosjs powered by Oraichain to easily interact with the network.
